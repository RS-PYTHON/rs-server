    Test the EODAG providers error handling during a download failure.

    This unit test aims to validate the robustness of the EODAG provider's download mechanism.

    1. A CADU product is initialized in the database with a status of NOT_STARTED.
    2. The `DataRetriever.download` method is mocked to trigger a runtime exception, simulating a download failure.
    3. A GET request is sent to the download endpoint, invoking the download process.
    4. The test verifies that the CADIP download status in the database is updated to FAILED as a result of the
