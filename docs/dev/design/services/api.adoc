= The API

The API is responsible for providing a REST endpoint
to access the core library functionalities.

It checks the requests parameters
and then uses the core library to fulfill the request.
Finally, it builds an adequate response.

NOTE: TODO insert the activity diagram api/activity.mmd

The API is responsible for handling the REST interface.
It does no functional process.
All functional processes are done by the library.

== Service API structure

All service API layers share the same structure.

NOTE: TODO insert the structure diagram

The service contains an api folder.
This folder contains a python file for each providing endpoint.


== Shared elements

All service api layer share common mechanism.
These mechanism are provided in a common api module.

// TODO describe the shared elements
// Probably useful param verification, logging, monitoring,...

== Framework used

This layer is implemented using <TODO make the tradeoff>.

// TODO give some rationale for this choice.
