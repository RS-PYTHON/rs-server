= Development workflow
:hardbreaks:

== Git

The project is using the https://git-flow.readthedocs.io/fr/latest/presentation.html[gitflow].

The feature branches are named following the pattern "feat-<jira-id>/<short-description>"
For example : "feat-rspy31/init-tech-doc"

Sometimes, a branch can implement multiple stories.
For example : "feat-rspy36-37/read-write-storage"

== JIRA tickets

The backlog is handled on a private JIRA instance.

The ticket is initially in the TODO state.
When the implementation starts, the state becomes "IN PROGRESS"
and the ticket is assigned to the responsible developer.
When the implementation is completed, the state becomes "IMPLEMENTED".
