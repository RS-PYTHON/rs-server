== Static View

We can split the system into following Components:

* *RS-Server*: The RS-Server controls user access to all sensitive interfaces: Catalog, LTA, ADGS, PRIP, CADIP. As a consequence, we can distinguish following components:

** *RS-Server Frontend*
** *RS-Server Backend / Catalog*
** *RS-Server Backend / PRIP*
** *RS-Server Backend / CADIP*
** *RS-Server Backend / LTA*
** *RS-Server Backend / AUXIP*

* *RS-Client libraries*: this is a set of python functions that provide processing task and flows. Flows and tasks can be orchestrated by Prefect server or executed from any Python environment. On RS-Server side there will be also function to compute performance indicator.

* *RS-Virtual environment*: Component that gives users access to computational environments and resources for executing processing chains.

* *Processing*: this group hosts all components to process Sentinel products. The CFI are not part of the group. Only wrappers, preparation worker and Dask cluster to provide processing power. Here are the components:

** *Dask cluster*
** *DPR libraries*

* *Infrastructure*: The infrastructure is a portable, extensible and open-source platform orchestrated by Kubernetes. We can isolate two specific layout which are monitoring and security. As a consequence, we can distinguish following components:

** *Infrastructure core*
** *Infrastructure monitoring*
** *Infrastructure security*
