= Install your environment

== Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes the developer has already basic knowledge
and is using a ubuntu working station.
This tutorial lets the user uses their preferred IDE.
You could extend your environment with specific IDE integration.

== Checkout the project

The source code is hosted on github.
You should configure your github token access before.

* Create a project folder that will contain all useful files

[source, bash]
----
RSPY_ROOT=~/projects/rspy
mkidr -P $RSPY_ROOT
mkdir $RSPY_ROOT/src/
cd $RSPY_ROOT
----

* Checkout the project

[source, bash]
----
cd $RSPY_ROOT/src
git clone --branch develop git@github.com:RS-PYTHON/rs-server.git
----

== Install Python

rs-server is using python 3.11.
You should install a compatible python version on your working station.

It is recommended to use https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv] to handle your python versions.
Pyenv provides you an easy way to switch between different python versions.

[source, bash]
----
cd $RSPY_ROOT/src
pyenv install 3.11.3
pyenv local 3.11.3
----

NOTE: The python version is an example. You could use more recent versions.

These commands install python 3.11 on your workstation and enforces this version for rs-server only.

== Install Poetry

The dependency management on rs-server is done with https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry].

Is it recommended to use https://github.com/pypa/pipx[pipx] to install your python tools.
Pipx provides you with isolated environment for your python tools.

[source, bash]
----
cd $RSPY_ROOT/src
pipx install poetry
----

== Setup the project

The project is managed by poetry.

You should first initialize the project locally
[source, bash]
----
cd $RSPY_ROOT/src/rs-server
poetry install --with dev
----
This command initializes and activates a virtual environment for your project.
It installs in this environment the project dependencies
and the develop dependencies (--with dev).

NOTE: Your IDE can provide poetry integration.

== Verify your local environment

To verify your environment is correctly installed,
you can run the unittests and verify that they run nominally

[source, bash]
----
cd $RSPY_ROOT/src/rs-server
pytest tests -m "unit"
----

// TODO give the extract of the expected result

NOTE: Your IDE can provide integration to run your unittests.

== Install trivy

link:https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/[trivy] is used to perform security and license checks on the repository, the generated wheel packages and the docker images.

trivy is run on the pre-commit and the CI
to verify the repository compliance with common vulnerabilities, secrets and licenses.

To install trivy on your local environment,
follow link:https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/getting-started/installation/[the official procedure].

== Install pre-commit hooks

pre-commit is used to check basic rules before each commit.
You should activate them :

[source, bash]
----
cd $RSPY_ROOT/src/rs-server
poetry run pre-commit install
----

Once installed, checks will be performed before each commit
to ensure your code is compliant with project best practices :

* assert no unresolved merge conflicts
* fix end of file
* fix trailing whitespace
* check toml
* run black formatter
* run linters
* run trivy repo checks

NOTE: It is useful to configure your IDE to run black at each file saving
so that you keep your code compliant with the project coding style.

== Additional IDE configuration

We will not give specific IDE configurations.
Nevertheless, it is relevant to configure your IDE
to run format and lint after each save
to keep your code compliant with the coding style at any moment.


== The next steps

The ${include("description.adoc")} can provide you with more details about the environment.
The ${include("../background/workflow.adoc")} describes the workflow followed by developers to implement stories.
You may also want to read the ${include("../code-style.adoc")}.
