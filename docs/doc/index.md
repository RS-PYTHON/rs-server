# RS-Server

RS-Server is a comprehensive toolbox designed to facilitate the retrieval of external data for Copernicus processing
chains. It allows users to store data into object storages and index it into STAC compatible catalogs.

The primary objective of RS-Server is to support Copernicus processing chains in executing their tasks efficiently.

## Features

The toolbox provides REST endpoints that enable users to:

* Search for external data.
* Stage external data.
* Index staged data into STAC compatible catalogs.
* Search for data within the catalog.
* Serve data to Copernicus [EOPF-CPM](https://cpm.pages.eopf.copernicus.eu/eopf-cpm/main/index.html) processors.

All these functionalities are available exclusively to authorized users. Permissions can be both technical and
functional.
